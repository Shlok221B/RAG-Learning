'''
API Keys:

OPEN_AI_KEY and HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN are set with values to authenticate with OpenAI and Hugging Face services respectively. Again, it is important to avoid sharing API keys publicly.
Access the OpenAI API Key:

The OpenAI API key is assigned to the variable openai_api_key.
Create an Instance of the OpenAI Class:

llm_instance is an instance of the OpenAI class, which is initialized with the API key and a temperature parameter.
temperature=0.6 is a parameter that controls the randomness of the model's output. A higher temperature results in more random output, while a lower temperature makes the output more deterministic.
Model Prediction:

The predict method is called on llm_instance with the prompt "What is the capital of India?".
The model processes the input and generates a response, which is then printed.

About OpenAI API
OpenAI API is a cloud-based service provided by OpenAI that allows developers to integrate OpenAI's advanced language models into their applications. Here are some key aspects of the OpenAI API:

Access to Advanced Models:

OpenAI API provides access to some of the most advanced language models, including GPT-3, which can perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks.
Versatile Capabilities:

The models can be used for text generation, translation, summarization, question answering, and more.
Ease of Use:

The API is designed to be user-friendly, with simple HTTP requests. Developers can quickly integrate the models into their applications using standard RESTful APIs.
Customization:

Parameters like temperature, max_tokens, top_p, and frequency_penalty allow developers to fine-tune the behavior and output of the models to suit specific needs.
Security and Privacy:

OpenAI takes data security and privacy seriously, providing features and assurances to protect user data.
Developer Tools and Resources:

OpenAI offers extensive documentation, examples, and SDKs in various programming languages to help developers get started and effectively use the API.
Community and Support:

OpenAI provides support through various channels and has a community of developers who contribute to forums and discussions.
